# RPA-Learning-Trail
This project demonstrates my hands-on experience in building, testing, and deploying RPA bots using Automation Anywhere 360. The focus was on creating efficient and scalable automation solutions, improving operational workflows, and segregating various file formats for better document management.

Key Features
Invoice Segregation Bot
During my internship, I developed a task bot for segregating invoice documents, PDFs, and text files. The bot:

Preprocesses each file type.
Segregates files based on format.
Stores them at predefined locations, ensuring efficient organization and retrieval.
Resume Bot Automation
I also designed a comprehensive RPA solution called the Resume Bot, which integrates the functionality of three sub-bots to manage complex workflows:

Input Flow Manager – Manages input acquisition and initial data handling.
Process Flow Manager – Handles core process automation and task execution.
Output Flow Manager – Aggregates results and generates outputs.
The Resume Bot monitors the status of these sub-bots and merges their outputs into a Main Task Bot, ensuring smooth integration and execution of the entire process.

Tools Used
Automation Anywhere 360: Used for designing, testing, and deploying all the bots involved in the project.
